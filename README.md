### Hi Developer 👋

I am an ABAP developer 😍 and I work a lot with the Business Technology Platform (BTP) and the ABAP Environment. Create best practices, guidelines and tutorials for colleagues and the rest of the world. You can find articles and other things in the SAP world on the blog [software-heroes](https://software-heroes.com/en/). In addition to ABAP, I also implement projects in Dart and PHP... yes, PHP still exists 😜 Im blogging in German and English.

Actual projects:
- ABAP Feature Matrix - Overview of the features for every release in a compact overview.
- ABAP Cloud - A complexe topic and much to learn for a ABAP developer.
- shortMe - Free URL shortener, where you can also link your own domain.
